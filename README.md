I am trying to create a new enemyshooter which is able to shoot bullets. I have sucessfully create the new enemy prefab
I created a spawn point for the enemy prefab so they will spawn from the spawn point
I create a attack point on the enemy prefab so the bullets will shoot from the enemy prefab when they spawns
I can't go forward because I was trying to make the bullets damage work but i failed,
The enemyshooters can move can shoot but I can't make them fit the game I think I need to redo the bullet scripts or something
